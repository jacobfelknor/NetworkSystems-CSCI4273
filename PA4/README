to build the project:
    make

remove binaries:
    make clean

binary stored in ./bin/dfc, ./bin/dfs

Usage: 
    ./bin/dfc <command> [filename] ... [filename]
    ./bin/dfs <directory> <port>

Assumptions:
    md5 is a 128 bit value. Instead of trying to use an int that big, 
    I stick with a 64 bit long long and take the last half of the md5
    for hashing

    I've got a lot of hardcoded stuff assuming 4 servers. My code only
    handles this case

    I require read/write permissions to the /tmp directory for my implementation
