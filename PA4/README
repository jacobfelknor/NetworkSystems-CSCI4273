to build the project:
    make

remove binaries:
    make clean

binary stored in ./bin/dfc, ./bin/dfs

Usage: 
    ./bin/dfc <command> [filename] ... [filename]
    ./bin/dfs <directory> <port>

Assumptions:
    

Plan:
    split file into 4 equal parts (with one having some remainder)
    name them filename.ext.(1|2|3|4)

    server looks a lot like webserver. Parse the request from user
    and respond accordingly. Start with PUT

    PUT filename.1 123\r\n  --> save the next 123 bytes to filename.1

    to get.. ask each server for filename.1 until i get it back
    ask each server for filename.2 until i get it back
    etc.
    if i can find all 4 parts, we're good! Reconstruct file and write to disk
    if i can't, write the incomplete file to disk and warn the user

    to list... ask each server in the same fashion as get. 
    this time, the server will just respond with a binary yes/no instead of sending content
    if i can find all 4 parts, list normal. else list incomplete
