to build the project:
    make

remove binaries:
    make clean

binary stored in ./bin/dfc, ./bin/dfs

Usage: 
    ./bin/dfc <command> [filename] ... [filename]
    ./bin/dfs <directory> <port>

Assumptions:
    

Plan:
    split file into 4 equal parts (with one having some remainder)
    name them filename.ext.(1|2|3|4)

    server looks a lot like webserver. Parse the request from user
    and respond accordingly. Start with PUT

    PUT filename.1 123\r\n\r\n  --> save the next 123 bytes to filename.1
