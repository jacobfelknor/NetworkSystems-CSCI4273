to build the project:
    make

remove binaries:
    make clean

binary stored in ./bin/proxy

Usage: 
    ./bin/proxy <port> <cacheage>

Assumptions:
    assuming a ./cache folder already exists in the current directory.
    blocklist file is optional - if it DNE my proxy blocks nothing
    blocklist file changes will go into effect after the cache for that page has expired (or immediately if cache DNE for host)

    Proxy does not work for secured https connections. Plain http only.
